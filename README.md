## FSM Staking Platform README

Welcome to the FSM Staking Platform repository! This platform allows users to stake their FSM tokens and earn rewards in the form of Saucy Meat Balls (SMB) tokens with a generous APR of 75%. Dive into DeFi with a fun twist and start growing your digital assets today.
Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-typescript-starter
```

Begin by editing pages/index.tsx to tailor the staking platform to your needs. The platform is live-updating, allowing for seamless development experience.

Within pages/_app.tsx, you'll find the ThirdwebProvider encapsulating your app. This setup is crucial for enabling the use of our hooks and UI Components found at:
[Hooks Documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react)
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components)

## Environment Variables

To ensure the staking platform runs smoothly, certain environment variables need to be set. Refer to .env.example for a comprehensive list. These variables should be added to your .env.local file or configured directly on your hosting service.

## Deploy to IPFS

Deploy your staking platform to IPFS using:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
